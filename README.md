Sample code for a book (Delphi XE2 Foundations) plus some other stuff people may find useful - an FMX TClipboard, a TCustomIniFile descendant that wraps the Mac Preferences API, and a simple wrapper for creating a PDF on OS X by drawing to a FireMonkey TCanvas. All require XE2 or greater, and the Delphi compiler and RTL (FPC not supported).

Unfortunately, the XE3 IDE's Subversion integration is incompatible with Google Code's (XE2's is fine).
